            <h2>Morocco to Frankfurt</h2>
<p>Well, that was a nighmare and a half!</p>
<p>I took a two hour taxi ride from Rabat to the Casablanca airport.  At the
airport, it turns out I was delivered to the wrong terminal.  Normally that's
not such a big deal, since you can walk between the two pretty easily, but
when you have a porter pushing your luggage and a guy from a different airline
pushing your wheelchair, it's irksome &ndash; and it increases your tip load.</p>

<p><center>Waiting for check-in to open</center></p>
<p>I got to the Lufthansa check-in area so early that there wasn't anyone to
check me in for a good hour or so.  That was OK, since it gave me a chance
to use the free WiFi from my phone to give updates and make arrangements.<br  />
Then, at check-in.  &ldquo;Where's your paperwork showing that this cast is at
least 48 hours old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To back up a bit, the PC instructions on Morocco recommends saying we medical
evacuees are &ldquo;on official Peace Corps business,&rdquo; to avoid complicated
questions about medical care.  Nice idea, but it doesn't work when you've
got an obviously freshly-made cast/bandage sticking way out in front of you.
I didn't have the Moroccan PC phone anymore, either.  I tried calling to
Morocco over WiFi, but Google Voice doesn't work to Morocco.  So, I called
the emergency duty officer in Washington, DC, and had her call my PC doctor
in Morocco, Dr. Tawfiq.  He called me (on my US Google Voice number), and we
handed the phone to the check-in lady.  After about five minutes of
Arabic conversation, she was satisfied, and she printed my boarding passes
and invited me to the VIP lounge after security.</p>
<p>At security, I was asked &ldquo;where is your certificate?&rdquo; accompanied by
pointing to my leg.  Oh boy.</p>
<p>After some fudging around, they called a supervisor, and ran me through
the other scanning machine that works through casts.  Good?  No.  Now the
supervisor gets a stick up his butt about how it's not normal that I don't
have paperwork.  He (and the other security people) also hardly speak
French.  He can communicate to me that he's not happy I have no paperwork,
but he has no idea what I'm saying in reply (which would have been about
electronic medical records, and the Peace Corps having received the bill
directly).  Not understanding French just made him more belligerent.
I even brought out my &ldquo;for medical eyes only&rdquo; X-ray, and on his
direction opened it, and showed it to him.  Not good enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to talk to my doctor?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;  After like the fifth repetition,
he finally understands my very simple French sentence, and he says yes.  So,
another call to DC.  Now the Lufhansa guy pushing my
wheelchair knows the drill with my Moroccan doctor, and offers his phone
(once I explain why I have to go through DC).  He calls him directly, and
of course gets a busy signal because DC is busy calling Dr. Tawfiq on my
behalf.  Ahem.  He tries again in 60 seconds, gets him, and
passes the phone to the head security guy.</p>
<p>And they talk.  And talk.  And talk and talk and talk.  It's pretty clear to
me that the security guy is just beating up on me because his Viagra supply
is running low, but there's nothing I can do about that.  After maybe 30
minutes of this (and closing in on an hour plus at security), they call the
airport head over.</p>
<p>The airport head comes, and I can see from the expression on his face that
he's going to be a lot more reasonable.  He goes over the case.  He then
asks to see my &ldquo;medical eyes only&rdquo; X-ray.  I'm pretty sure this was just to
give him enough of an excuse to overrule the security guy.  Anyway, he sees
my name, the date and the clinc name on the X-rays, and points out these
features to the head security guy.  Then he gives me a thumbs-up.</p>
<p>On the way out, the security guy asks for Dr. Tawfiq's number.  The Lufthansa
guy has it on his phone, of course, so he gives it to him.  As we're wheeling
away, the security guy called Dr. Tawfiq, and had another long, rambling
discourse on the unacceptability on moral grounds of not having a bunch
of paperwork, and doubtless other moral, ethical and sartorial
shortcomings of myself.  I'm afraid Dr. Tawfiq may have acquired a new stalker.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my 2 hours of slack time to use the business lounge, post the
blog etc. has dissappeared into a puff of security pissing contest.  I get
to the gate about five minutes before my 2 AM boarding time, about 30 minutes
before the flight leaves.</p>
<p>Lordy.</p>
<p>I hope there's no second security check in Frankfurt with certificate-hungry
officials.</p>
<h2>Frankfurt:  The Nightmare Continues</h2>
<p>Actually, the opposite of that.  Things couldn't have gone more smoothly.  No
jetway, so the elevator truck took me to my own private bus.  The secondary
security screening for US-bound flights was a snap.  I was pushed around in
a lovely wheelchair for all if it.</p>
<p>In the business lounge, there was plenty of time and internet - got to
connect my computer for the first time in weeks!  I got to learn how to
steer a wheelchair, and experience the majesty that is the modern, Western
handicap-accessible restroom.  All those handles are amazing!</p>

<p><center>Frankfurt Airport</center></p>
<p>I completely fit in the Lufthansa A380-800 (the double-decker Airbus).<br  />
Maybe the hardest part was figuring out my prescription drug schedule
with the time changes!  I'm still on anti-malarials for a bit, and I'm
taking an antibiotic and an anti-coagulant, both for another week.</p>
<p>I'm comfortable doing things like hopping around, like to the restroom.<br  />
I simply wouldn't have fit in coach, since I can't bend my knee, but other
than that I'm reasonably mobile.  For the same reason, I don't think normal
cars will work for me for the next 5-6 weeks.  But anyway, the final leg of
my journey was trouble-free, and the food was excellent!</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>My sister Lisle met me at the airport.  She took the bus there, and we took
a taxi back &ndash; they have van taxis with a bunch of open space in front of
the seat.  I had to have the driver get in the van and hold me up
from behind to work my way in, but it was OK.</p>
<p>Now I've had a good night's sleep, and I'm getting ready to do laundry,
find out how to get a disabled tag for parking, figure out mass transit
options, and basically start planning all those little details.  It
turns out I <em>can</em> fit in the back of my sister's Prius if the front
seat is pushed all the way forward, so that's a game changer.</p>
<p>I'm home.</p>
