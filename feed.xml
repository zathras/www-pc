          With three months to go, I'm still waiting for my clearances to come through.  Things are a bit on hold until they do.

        <description>
          I made it to Ouagadougu, and everything is going great!  I'm too mentally exhausted to write a real post, but I just wanted to get this word out, and let you all know my phone number.

          We all came to the training center in Léo today, and I'm moving in to my home for the next three months.  I also found out where I'll be living for the two years after that!

        <description>
          Today was Eid al Fitr, the end of the month of Ramadan.  For a while, it became like the part of Halloween for kids.  I've got a few pictures of that, and me and some of the other PCTs.  In some ways, things are beginning to get a little tough, but it's still great to be here.

          Two more volunteers have gone home, which is rough.  I'm still doing well, though.  Everybody is looking forward to the site visit in a couple of weeks, when we'll get to see our new homes for the next two years.

          Like Thoreau, I took up farming to know farming.  I lasted maybe five minutes, but took lots of pictures.  Also, a few observations on who do that voodoo that some do so well.

        <description>
          I've reached a Peace Corps milestone:  My first serious questioning of what I'm doing here, and if it's all worth it.  I think it is, but it's too soon for me to have an informed judgement; what is clear is that after learning more, I'll have some 'splaining to do to myself.

          A motorcycle ran into me and broke my leg rather badly, so I'm coming home soon.  This post was written a little over a week after the accident, from a hospital bed in Rabat, Morocco.

          My trip back from Morocco to L.A.  I see the pattern now:  Every time I do medevac travel, something breathtakingly horrible happens :-)  But I'm back in L.A., and fine.

          (Written Sept. 2)  Terrible news.  I found out a couple of days ago that the Peace Corps is evacuating all of the volunteers from Burkina Faso.  I have to hold publication until this was made public.  I'm broken hearted; I can only imagine how everyone there feels.

          Today's my last day in the Peace Corps, before I'm medically seperated (i.e. fired).  Some thoughts on Burkina Faso, ZPG, development and the Peace Corps.  Finally, a word or two about my medical state and prognosis.
